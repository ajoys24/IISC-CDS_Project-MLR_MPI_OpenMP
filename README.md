Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression using MPI and OpenMP
At the end of the mini-project, you will be able to :

understand the collective communication operations like scatter, gather, broadcast
understand the blocking and non-blocking communication
implement multiple linear regression and run it using MPI
implement the multiple linear regression based predictions using OpenMP
